# nughud_modern

A new, modern HUD layout for the Nugget Doom source port.

![README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liPillON/nughud_modern/main/README.png)


## Features:
- re-arranged Doom's stock HUD elements
- restored HEALTH/ARMOR/AMMO stbar labels
- support both 4:3 and Widescreen aspect ratios
- tweaked palette for STGNUMx and STYSNUMx lumps


## Limitations:
- to ensure consistency across pwads, this wad includes stock DOOM2.WAD graphics assets
- for the same reason as the above, this wad should be loaded AFTER all other pwads
